\footnotesize

In John Deere, I have had the fortune to work in multiple functions in various capacities and also in all the manufacturing facilities, Pune, Dewas \emph{(I relocated there)} and Sirhind factories.\\
The other significant aspect of my career has been the privilege to explore multiple facets of the functions; developing components at one end and developing factory sourcing at another.\\
The journey continues\ldots{}

\subsection{Working with Data}\label{working-with-data}}

With technology and data being increasingly accessible, leveraging these offer tremendous opportunities in changing the way we work, bringing in a completely new paradigm, enabling us to ask questions and expect \textbf{\emph{reproducible and repeatable}} answers to those questions.\\
Seeing the potential of data in my area of work, I am working on driving progress in this exciting domain.\\
Here is summary of the work initiated in OFP:

\detailedsection{\detaileditem{\textbf{Data Pipeline}}{}{}{}{\item{Worked on developing {\textit{\textbf{strong underlying process}}} to ensure our data capturing is {\textit{\textbf{consistent}}} and at point of generation.}\item{Leveraged the SAP - HANA sidecar for accessing the data our process generate.}\item{This is a very significant portion of the digitization journey and takes time. Established and ingrained the new processes into our work culture abalbing a high degree of reliance on the underlying data and it's reliability; making it reproducible and repeatable.}}\detaileditem{\textbf{Replace}}{}{}{}{\item{As a first step worked on {\textit{\textbf{making analysis automated}}} which were otherwise generated by individuals.}\item{To make the process smooth and make sure we develop trust on the new system, started replacing one analysis at a time, deploying automated process in-parallel.}\item{{\textit{\textbf{Leveraged R - open source programming language}}} to connect the data and work with it to deliver majority of the analytics, deploying programmers where necessary.}\item{Example of automated analytics include our OFP on-track report and shipment analytics, order bank analysis, configuration process automation, production control process improvements etc.}}\detaileditem{\textbf{Innovate}}{}{}{}{\item{With the analytics in-place, focus is on going beyond and getting more values out of the data.}\item{As an example of this approach, leveraged historical sales to {\textit{\textbf{generate rolling sales forecast}}} utilizing multiple forecasting models and ensembling the results.}\item{Another area was to identify current equivalent products for the old obsolete ones. I deployed {\textit{\textbf{clustering approach using machine learning algorithm}}} to automate this process.}\item{A third example is deployment of {\textit{\textbf{SAP - IBP}}}, a first in Deere Worldwide for making our S\&OP process capable, fast and structured.}\item{As a next step in this journey we have now initiated few {\textit{\textbf{fully autonomous deployment}}},making analytics available on schedule.}}\detaileditem{\textbf{My skills}}{}{}{}{\item{Understanding of Data Science, leveraging the same for Business Analytics and lead transformation projects.\hspace*{\fill} {\textit{ - Expert.}}}\item{R Programming Language for analytics, visualization and reporting. \hspace*{\fill}  {\textit{- Moderate.}}}\item{Tableau for data visualization and reports. \hspace*{\fill}  {\textit{- Moderate.}}}\item{MS Excel. \hspace*{\fill}  {\textit{- Expert.}}}\item{Python Programming Language. \hspace*{\fill}  {\textit{- Beginner.}}}\item{This resume is programmatically generated using R-language and vitae package.
