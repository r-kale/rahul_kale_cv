\subsection{Working with Data}\label{working-with-data}}

With technology and data being increasingly accessible, leveraging these
offer tremendous opportunities in changing the way we work, bringing in
a completely new paradigm, enabling us to ask questions and expect
\textbf{\emph{reproducible and repeatable}} answers to those
questions.\\
Seeing the potential of data in my area of work, I am working on driving
progress in this exciting domain.\\
Here is summary of the work initiated in OFP:

\begin{cventries}
    \cventry{\textbf{Data Pipeline}}{}{}{}{\begin{cvitems}
\item Worked on developing {\textit{\textbf{strong underlying process}}} to ensure our data capturing is {\textit{\textbf{consistent}}} and at point of generation.
\item Leveraged the SAP - HANA sidecar for accessing the data our process generate.
\item This is a very significant portion of the digitization journey and takes time. Established and ingrained the new processes into our work culture abalbing a high degree of reliance on the underlying data and it's reliability; making it reproducible and repeatable.
\end{cvitems}}
    \cventry{\textbf{Replace}}{}{}{}{\begin{cvitems}
\item As a first step worked on {\textit{\textbf{making analysis automated}}} which were otherwise generated by individuals.
\item To make the process smooth and make sure we develop trust on the new system, started replacing one analysis at a time, deploying automated process in-parallel.
\item {\textit{\textbf{Leveraged R - open source programming language}}} to connect the data and work with it to deliver majority of the analytics, deploying programmers where necessary.
\item Example of automated analytics include our OFP on-track report and shipment analytics, order bank analysis, configuration process automation, production control process improvements etc.
\end{cvitems}}
    \cventry{\textbf{Innovate}}{}{}{}{\begin{cvitems}
\item With the analytics in-place, focus is on going beyond and getting more values out of the data.
\item As an example of this approach, leveraged historical sales to {\textit{\textbf{generate rolling sales forecast}}} utilizing multiple forecasting models and ensembling the results.
\item Another area was to identify current equivalent products for the old obsolete ones. I deployed {\textit{\textbf{clustering approach using machine learning algorithm}}} to automate this process.
\item A third example is deployment of {\textit{\textbf{SAP - IBP}}}, a first in Deere Worldwide for making our S\&OP process capable, fast and structured.
\item As a next step in this journey we have now initiated few {\textit{\textbf{fully autonomous deployment}}},making analytics available on schedule.
\end{cvitems}}
    \cventry{\textbf{My skills}}{}{}{}{\begin{cvitems}
\item Understanding of Data Science, leveraging the same for Business Analytics and lead transformation projects.\hspace*{\fill} {\textit{ - Expert.}}
\item R Programming Language for analytics, visualization and reporting. \hspace*{\fill}  {\textit{- Moderate.}}
\item Tableau for data visualization and reports. \hspace*{\fill}  {\textit{- Moderate.}}
